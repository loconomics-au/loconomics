                        <p>A cooperative model means that every professional is an owner and has an equal vote in the election of the Loconomics board, consisting of fellow professionals, and in other major decisions. It also means that the profits generated by Loconomics will be returned to the owners, in proportion to their participation in generating profits.</p>

                            <p>Josh has an extensive background in business and has hopped between pricing and revenue management, analytics, product strategy and management, contract negotiations, and more. He has two business degrees, if you can believe it, the first (a Bachelor's) from the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management, the second (an MBA) from IESE Business School in Barcelona. Josh is nearly as tall as Twin Peaks, the neighborhood he calls home, and prides himself on being able to change most lightbulbs without “any sort of ladder.” He is currently learning to surf and heads down to Santa Cruz to practice. Josh deeply admires the historian Howard Zinn, who wanted to be remembered “for getting more people to realize that the power which rests so far in the hands of people with wealth and guns, that the power ultimately rests in people themselves and that they can use it.” </p>

                        <h2>Staff trusteeship</h2>
                        <p>Tired of climbing a ladder to nowhere? Loconomics is taking a different approach to work. Staff trusteeship is a model of organizational governance that views all staff members of the cooperative as trustees of its mission. Staff trusteeship may emerge as a best practice in the governance of cooperatives with a large and geographically dispersed membership base. While the cooperative exists to benefit its members, it may be the full-time staff of the cooperative – not the Board of Directors – that is most capable and available to be directly accountable to the large membership base.</p>
                        <p>In comparison to staff of conventional businesses and organizations, all staff in a staff trusteeship cooperative have heightened responsibility, and, as such, heightened influence within the cooperative. In order to carry out their heightened responsibilities, each staff member will have relatively equal powers to that of other staff members. Each staff member will have opportunities to influence the activities of the cooperative and to influence their realm of work within the cooperative. The Staff Trustees shall use an internal governance/operational model, such as holacracy, that distributes power among them, ensuring a great deal of agency for each staff member.</p>
