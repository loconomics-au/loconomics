                    <p>
                        The Loconomics Service is a communications and client management platform for connecting people offering Services ("Service
                        Professionals") and people looking for Services ("Clients"). Service Professionals, Website visitors,
                        Clients, and other users of the Loconomics Service together are referred to as "Users." The work
                        that a Service Professional will provide to a Client, and for which the Client will pay the Service
                        Professional, is referred to as "Services." Services also include any materials provided by the Service
                        Professional, either with or without charge, to the Client. Loconomics creates a neutral venue for
                        Service Professionals to find Clients, and for Clients to find Service Professionals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users contract for Services directly with other Users. Loconomics does not take part in the Services provided to Clients
                        by Service Professionals and will not be a party to any contracts for Services. Rather, Loconomics
                        is merely a communication, scheduling, and payment processing platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When using the Loconomics Service, you may be a Service Professional, a Client, or both.

                    <p>
                        Users do not have authority to enter into contracts or commitments, whether written or oral, implied or express, on behalf
                        of Loconomics.

                        Loconomics is not an employer of the Service Professionals and Service Professionals do not become Loconomics employees by
                        providing Services to Clients or by becoming Owners of Loconomics. You acknowledge that we do not
                        supervise, direct, control, or make representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness,
                        or accuracy of the Services offered and provided by Service Professionals through the Loconomics
                        Service in any manner. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee
                        relationship is intended or created by this Agreement or by the receipt of any benefits or advantages
                        received by Service Professionals through Loconomics. As such, we will not be liable for any tax
                        or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment insurance, employer's liability, Government Benefits, 
                        or payroll withholding tax in connection with your use of the Loconomics Service. You understand
                        and agree that if we are found to be liable for any tax or tax withholding in connection with your
                        use of Services, then you will immediately reimburse and pay to us an equivalent amount, including
                        any interest or penalties thereon. You further agree to indemnify, hold harmless, reimburse (for
                        taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees), and defend us from any and all claims that a Service
                        Professional was misclassified as an independent contractor or an employee, any claims that we were
                        an employer or joint employer of a Service Professional, and any claims under any employment-related
                        laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation,
                        wage and hour laws, overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's
                        compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.

                    <p>
                        Service Professionals are solely responsible for all aspects of the Services they perform, including the quality, timing,
                        legality, or failure to provide Services. Loconomics does not control the actions or inactions of
                        Users.

                        Loconomics does not provide any materials or supplies to provide the Services. Service Professionals must provide their own
                        tools and equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals manage their own schedules, availability, pricing, and quality of Services provided.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics does not require training for Service Professionals, apart from training that the Service Professional must obtain
                        for providing Licensed Professional Services. However, optional training may be offered as a benefit
                        for Loconomics Owners.

                        Service Professionals are encouraged their services to advertise independently of the Loconomics platform.

                    <p>
                        One purpose of forming Loconomics as a cooperative is to provide ideal working opportunities and conditions to independent
                        Service Professionals, while ensuring that Services Professionals remain independent and have choice
                        and flexibility in their work.

                        and nonprofit organizations may be Service Professionals if approved as Owners according to the Bylaws
                        and any other policies specifically applicable to worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations.
                        Except in the case of worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit organizations, your profile 
                        must represent a single person performing Services; you may not have employees, agents, or substitutes
                        provide Services on your behalf.

                        Service Professionals may choose to partner with other Service Professionals using our group scheduling functionality to
                        perform particular Services that require more than one person. In such cases, Service Professionals
                        must still be individuals, not agencies or people acting on behalf of agencies.

                        Service Professionals must perform Services at the scheduled time and as described to the Client when scheduling or, if you
                        are unable to fulfill Services at the scheduled time, you must promptly notify the Client and cancel
                        or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.

                    <p>
                        Clients are solely responsible for choosing suitable Service Professionals. Loconomics does not endorse any Service Professional.
                        When acting as a Client, you agree that Loconomics is not responsible or liable for unsatisfactory
                        Services performed by Service Professionals. You should make whatever investigation you deem necessary
                        or appropriate before hiring or engaging a Service Professional (see also Section 19, "Background
                        Checks").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clients are responsible for attending (if so agreed at the time of scheduling) all appointments made through the Loconomics
                        Service or, if you are unable to attend an appointment, to promptly notify the Service Professional
                        and cancel or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may not hire Service Professionals with the purpose of reselling their Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will take the necessary safety precautions when meeting Service Professionals to ensure both their and your own safety.

                    <p>
                        You accept responsibility to confirm that the Service Professional's identity and professional license or certification (if
                        required) match the information on their profile.

                    <p>
                        If you are a Service Professional, you may use the Loconomics Service free of charge for a limited time per any promotional
                        terms ("Trial Period"). After the Trial Period has ended, payment of a monthly or annual fee "User
                        Fee" is required to continue using the Loconomics Service. A valid credit card is required, and the
                        User Fee is billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis ("Billing Period") in accordance with
                        our pricing schedule. Payment for the first Billing Period of service will become due immediately
                        upon the end of the Trial Period; if you have not yet entered your credit card information, we will
                        prompt you for this information. You must enter your credit card information before the end of the

                        your credit card will be billed for each Billing Period after the Trial Period until your account
                        is terminated by you or by Loconomics. You warrant that the credit card you enter is valid,
                        and that you are authorized to use such credit card. You authorize Loconomics to charge such credit

                        your account if a charge to your credit card is denied or disputed. All payments are non-refundable;
                        Loconomics does not refund for partial months of service or non-use of the Loconomics Service. All

                        Loconomics may charge a fee to Clients upon scheduling of Services through the Loconomics Service. Any "Booking Fee" will
                        be disclosed at the time the scheduling is made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Loconomics charges a set fee for certain premium services, such as a Background Check. The cost of a premium service is disclosed
                        at the time you sign up for the premium service.

                        Loconomics deducts the Payment Service Provider's payment processing fees from the total amount paid by a Client for Services
                        before transferring the Payment Amount owed to a Service Professional.

                        Users of the Loconomics Service may be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Loconomics and the
                        Payment Service Provider "PSP" retained by Loconomics (currently, Stripe).

                        The cost of Services scheduled through the Loconomics Service, any agreed out of pocket expenses owed to the Service Professional,
                        any tip or gratuity, if applicable, and any service fees owed to Loconomics for the use of the Loconomics
                        Service are collectively referred to as the "Payment Amount."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When payment is required when scheduling Services, Loconomics will charge the Client's credit card the Payment Amount after
                        the appointment for the scheduled Services. Loconomics may also put a hold on the Client's credit
                        card for the Payment Amount at the time the appointment is scheduled through the Loconomics Service
                        to ensure that payment can be taken at the appropriate time. Certain Services may require that, by
                        a clearly stated deadline, a Client and/or Service Professional mark that Services are complete after
                        the appointment is finished and/or finalize a Payment Amount. Should the User not complete the requested
                        actions before the deadline, the User forfeits their right to make any adjustments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When payment is not required at the time of scheduling an appointment, the Client agrees to pay the Service Professional
                        the Payment Amount using the Service Professional's preferred payment option(s).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals may make bundles or packages available in which Users can purchase multiple Services or sessions in
                        a single transaction. All sessions of the Services must be scheduled through the Loconomics Service.
                        Service Professionals may set an expiration date for any bundle or package, and any unused package
                        value is lost as of the expiration date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clients may have the option of choosing that the Services to be repeated on a regular basis ("Recurrent Services"). For example,
                        a Client may choose that Services be performed every two weeks. When a Client chooses Recurrent Services,
                        Loconomics will automatically schedule those Recurrent Services to occur on future dates indefinitely
                        at the frequency requested by the Client. The Client's credit card will be charged for the Recurrent
                        Services as the appointments for Services occur and for any applicable cancellation fees. Loconomics
                        cannot guarantee appointments for Recurrent Services will not be canceled or rescheduled by the Service
                        Professional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Services may be canceled or rescheduled up to the "Cancellation Period" (the advance notice prior to the scheduled appointment
                        time required to effect an appointment cancellation outlined in the Service Professional's own policy
                        on cancellation ("Cancellation Policy") of the appointment to take place. If you wish to cancel or
                        reschedule Services, you must do so by using the appointment cancellation feature through the Loconomics
                        Service prior to any Cancellation Period for such Services. You understand and agree that should
                        you cancel or reschedule your Services after the Cancellation Period or if you do not show up for
                        your appointment time, you may be charged part of or the full value of the Services in accordance
                        with the Service Professional's Cancellation Policy ("Cancellation Fee").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service Professionals set their own Cancellation Policies, and Loconomics must enforce these Cancellation Policies. It is
                        therefore very important to understand a Service Professional's Cancellation Policy prior to attempting
                        to cancel or reschedule an appointment. A full refund of a Cancellation Fee may be issued to a Client
                        upon three events:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a) if the Client cancels Services before the Cancellation Period;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            b) if the Service Professional cancels the Client Services; or
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            c) if the Service Professional refuses to honor any Services at the agreed date and time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you wish to make a request for a refund, any such request for refund must be made within 48 hours after the scheduled
                        end time of the Services. For each valid refund request, Loconomics will refund the Payment Amount
                        upon request in the original form of payment, or will credit the User Account of the Client with
                        an equivalent value in Loconomics "Credits" for future purchases through the Loconomics Service.
                        Loconomics Credits do not expire.

                        provide a refund.

                    <p>
                        Loconomics Australia has designed this Background Check and License Verification Policy (this &#8220;Policy&#8221;) with
                        the goal of helping Clients feel at ease when scheduling Service Professionals, while creating work
                        opportunities for Service Professionals that may have been served by our justice system. Loconomics
                        intends to provide a platform for the exchange of services in an informed and fair manner. In most
                        cases, Background Checks will be done only at the option of the Service Professional, and Loconomics
                        will not perform a Background Check without the consent of the Service Professional. However, for
                        providers of &#8220;Sensitive Services,&#8221; defined below, Loconomics does require a Background
                        Check. In addition, Loconomics requires License Verification for Service Professionals providing
                        &#8220;Licensed Professional Services,&#8221; also defined below. The policy for and use of Background
                        Check and License Verification information is detailed in this Policy below.

                    <p>
                        Information discovered through the Background Check and License Verification processes will be used solely for the purpose
                        of evaluating a Service Professional&#8217;s suitability to provide Sensitive Services, Licensed
                        Professional Services, or other Services. It will not be used to discriminate against a Service Professional
                        on the basis of race, color, religion/creed, sex/gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression,
                        national origin, genetic information, marital/familial status, disability, military, veteran status,
                        or any other classification protected by law.

                            a) Service Professionals will be notified at the time they indicate their intent to provide Sensitive Services that they
                            must successfully pass a Background Check prior to offering to provide Sensitive Services via
                            the Loconomics Service.

                            b) Background Checks will be conducted in accordance with applicable law. Once a Service Professional indicates their intent
                            to provide Sensitive Services, Loconomics or appointed third-party vendor will provide the Service
                            Professional an authorization form. If requested, the Service Professional will be provided a copy of this
                            Background Check policy. Any Service Professional who refuses to sign and return this authorization
                            form consenting to a Background Check, refuses to provide information necessary to conduct the
                            Background Check, or provides false or misleading information will not be permitted to offer

                            c) Upon receiving the Service Professional&#8217;s signed authorization form, the Background Check will be initiated by the
                            Authorized Initiator. All Background Checks will be conducted by a third party service provider
                            (the &#8220;Vendor&#8221;) at the direction of the Authorized Initiator.

                            d) Upon completion of the Background Check, the Vendor will forward the results to the Authorized Initiator. The Vendor shall
                            also inform the Service Professional of the results, provide the Service Professional an opportunity
                            to review the report, and inform the Service Professional of their rights.

                            on the Service Professional&#8217;s profile page. If a Service Professional receives a Red Tier
                            rating, the Service Professional may not offer to provide Sensitive Services via the Loconomics
                            Service. The Service Professional may, however, offer to provide non-Sensitive Services via the
                            Loconomics Service.

                            If the Service Professional attempts to create a listing offering to provide Sensitive Services
                            without having undergone a Background Check, the Loconomics online Service will not permit the

                            the Background Check requirement. If the Service Professional attempts to add a category of Sensitive
                            Services to that Service Professional&#8217;s profile page, the Loconomics online Service will
                            block the Service Professional from offering these Sensitive Services via the Loconomics online

                        defined herein for any reason and at any time. In the event that a discretionary Background Check
                        is carried out, the Service Professional may choose to withdraw as a Service Professional from Loconomics
                        if the Service Professional does not wish to undergo or share results of a Background Check. If the
                        Service Professional opts to complete the Background Check, Loconomics shall publicly post the

                                is prohibited from offering Sensitive Services), Yellow Tier (meaning that the Service Professional
                                may offer Sensitive Services, but that the Service Professional&#8217;s suitability for offering
                                such services is below average), or Green Tier (meaning that the Service Professional&#8217;s

                            reliability of the charge information. Loconomics will consider any information revealed regarding
                            convictions, although a Conviction (defined as a guilty verdict, a guilty plea, or a pleas of
                            Nolo Contendere of felony or misdemeanor, other than minor traffic offenses) shall not automatically
                            preclude the individual from offering Sensitive Services or obtaining a &#8220;Green Tier&#8221;

                        Except as expressly stated herein or within the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, the Parties to this Agreement do not intend
                        to create any rights in any third parties.

                    <p>
                        This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties in connection with the subject matter herein and this Agreement
                        may be amended or modified only in a writing signed by the Parties. Either party may assign, sublicense,
                        delegate or transfer all or any portion of its rights or responsibilities under this Agreement by
                        operation of law or otherwise to any subsidiaries or affiliates thereof, or to any other party, in
                        connection with a sale of the business related to this Agreement or to the Arrangement Agreement.
                        Any assignment of this Agreement by Business Associate in connection with a sale of this business
                        shall relieve Business Associate from any further liability hereunder. None of the provisions of
                        this Agreement are intended to create, nor will they be deemed to create any relationship between
                        the Parties other than that of independent parties contracting with each other solely for the purposes
                        of effecting the provisions of this Agreement and any other agreements between the Parties evidencing
                        their business relationship. This Agreement will be governed by California law, without regard to
                        its choice of law provisions. No change, waiver or discharge of any liability or obligation hereunder
                        on any one or more occasions shall be deemed a waiver of performance of any continuing or other obligation,
                        or shall prohibit enforcement of any obligation, on any other occasion. In the event that any provision
                        of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the
                        remainder of the provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. In addition,
                        in the event a Party believes in good faith that any provision of this Agreement fails to comply
                        with the then-current requirements of the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, including any then-current
                        requirements of the HITECH Act or its regulations, such Party shall notify the other Party in writing.
                        For a period of up to thirty (30) days, the Parties shall address in good faith such concern and
                        amend the terms of this Agreement, if necessary to bring it into compliance. If, after such thirty
                        (30)-day period, the Agreement fails to comply with the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, including
                        the HITECH Act, then either Party has the right to terminate upon written notice to the other Party.

                    <h3>Minimum Requirements.</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Parties agree that, in the event that any documentation of the Arrangement Agreement pursuant to which Business Associate
                        provides services to Covered Entity contains provisions relating to the use or disclosure of Protected
                        Health Information that are more restrictive than the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions
                        of the more restrictive documentation will control. The provisions of this Agreement are intended
                        to establish the minimum requirements regarding the Parties&#8217; use and disclosure of Protected
                        Health Information.
