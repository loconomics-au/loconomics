/**
 * Cached Data Provider class, it let's to load, save, delete remote data keeping
 * a local cache for faster loads or even to enable working offline.
 * The basic tasks against remote are pretty straightforward: just make
 * requests for 'get, post, put, delete' with given data/query and return the
 * result.
 * But keeping a local cache, updated and invalidated properly, enforcing
 * a caching strategy is a bit more complicated.
 * For this class doesn't matters if the data is an object/item or an array/list,
 * doesn't expect something specific, is managed as a single thing without
 * making assumptions on content or doing more advanced things like indexing,
 * still allows to be used in APIs like 'fetch item by ID' or 'pull a list of
 * items, full or filtered by query', and not just for 'singleton, simple objects',
 * by accepting the implementation calls to both remote and local where that
 * logic is implemented and that ones are really simple to implement.
 *
 * All elements are documented and annotated, but more relevant API for usage are:
 * - onLoad
 * - onceLoaded
 * - save
 * - delete
 * - constructor: {
 *   ttl: number // of milliseconds
 *   remote: { fetch(), push(data), delete() } // returning Promises.
 *   local: { fetch(), push(data), delete() } // returning Promises
 * }
 *
 * Check IDataProviderDriver type definition at separated file.
 *
 * Not all cases where this class is used need to allow all the methods provided: not
 * allowing 'delete' is common for lists APIs, same with `save` for queries or prefixed/enforced
 * data. That's fine, and the remote/local implementations don't need to include them;
 * use the data module docs to specify which APIs are possible. But take care that
 * the local 'delete' method is needed for cache removal, even if the related
 * remote API does not allows deleting the data.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Never use externally members prefixed with underscore, are expected to be
 * private and can change/break at any point because of implementation details.
 *
 * NOTE: At the bottom are some inlined utilities and type definitions, plus
 * some IDEAs.
 *
 * @example Example with simple inlined providers, usually utilities for them
 * are created to reuse on different data modules.
 * ```
 * const api = new CachedDataProvider({
 *    // 1 minute
 *    ttl: 1 * 60 * 1000,
 *    // basic example with jQuery, preferible using 'fetch' or a specialized class for the app REST API.
 *    remote: {
 *        fetch: () => Promise.resolve(jQuery.get('url')),
 *        push: (data) => Promise.resolve(jQuery.ajax({ method: 'put', url: 'url', data: data })),
 *        delete: () => Promise.resolve(jQuery.ajax({ method: 'delete', url: 'url' }))
 *    },
 *    // needs to fix: parse/stringify should happen inside a promise to reject properly on error
 *    local: {
 *        fetch: () => localStorage.cachedDataName && Promise.resolve(JSON.parse(localStorage.cachedDataName)),
 *        push: (data) => (localStorage.cachedDataName = JSON.stringify(data)) && Promise.resolve(),
 *        delete: () => (delete localStorage.cachedDataName) && Promise.resolve()
 *    }
 * });
 * ```

// IDEA: An event 'onFreshData' that filters notifications from 'onData' based
// on a 'comparer setting'. Details
// - `settings.comparer` is a function that compares latest notified data
// and incoming one, only emitting if is different; can use all-props comparision or
// serialization comparision as a generic, opt-in method or a timestamp field,
// recommended way that should be provided by implementer).
// - One caveat: needs to keep an in memory copy of last value and may enable
// a subscription to onData all the time even if unused; same problems to the
// idea of a PersistentSingleEvent class.
// - without this: user code needs to do its comparision or trust any notified
// data as different and newer. That's important to prevent doing extra work,
// trashing and redoing UI, or more important replacing form data for an item
// being edited with newer data (onData should be not used for that cases
// anyway because of that problem, except it includes a mechanism to manage
// this).

// IDEA: rather that just use a TTL as caching strategy, a class can be defined
// for a common interface (a base CachedData with data and mustRevalidate members,
// later extended with anything else the implemented strategy needs to persist,
// like the 'latest' field for TTL). That way the strategy is provided at constructor
// like the implementations for remote and local calls, and moving out some
// details like mustRevalidate utility while letting other strategies to be
// implemented.
