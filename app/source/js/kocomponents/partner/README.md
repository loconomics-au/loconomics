# Knockout Components for partner specific user interface
Components here are meant to be used by 'partner-' activities to implement
the specific administrative tasks or other ressources made available just
to users part of a partnership.
But that components **are not limited to this package**, some components
used for that purposes may be located at other packages when makes more sense,
specially if other general components there need to be aware to keep
compatible, like happens with the 'earnings' package that includes the
'earnings-admin-filters' component and works fine with the others like
'earnings-report'.
