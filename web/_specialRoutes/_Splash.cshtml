              <p>	<strong>3. Neutral Venue</strong>

              </p>
              <p>The Loconomics Service is a communications and client management platform
                for connecting people offering Services (“Service Professionals”) and people
                looking for Services (“Clients”). Service Professionals, site visitors,
                Clients, and other users of the Loconomics Service together are referred
                to as "Users." The work that a Service Professional will provide to a Client,
                and for which the Client will pay the Service Professional, is referred
                to as “Services.” Services also include any materials provided by the Service
                Professional, either with or without charge to the Client. Loconomics creates
                a neutral venue for Service Professionals to find Clients, and for Clients
                to find Service Professionals.</p>
              <p>Users contract for Services directly with other Users. Loconomics does
                not take part in the Services provided to Clients by Service Professionals
                and will not be a party to any contracts for Services. Rather, Loconomics
                is merely a communication, scheduling, and payment processing platform.</p>
              <p>When using the Loconomics Service, you may be a Service Professional,
                a Client, or both.</p>
              <p>Users do not have authority to enter into contracts or commitments, whether
                written or oral, implied or express, on behalf of Loconomics.</p>
              <p>	<strong>4. No Employment of Service Professionals</strong>

              </p>
              <p>Loconomics is not an employer of the Service Professionals and Service
                Professionals do not become Loconomics employees by providing Services
                to Clients or by becoming Owners of Loconomics. You acknowledge that we
                do not supervise, direct, or control, make representations about the suitability,
                reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Services offered and provided
                by Service Professionals through the Loconomics Service in any manner.
                No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee
                relationship is intended or created by this Agreement or by receiving any
                benefits or advantages received by Service Professionals through Loconomics.
                As such, we will not be liable for any tax or withholding, including but
                not limited to unemployment insurance, employer's liability, social security
                or payroll withholding tax in connection with your use of the Loconomics
                Service. You understand and agree that if we are found to be liable for
                any tax or tax withholding in connection with your use of Services, then
                you will immediately reimburse and pay to us an equivalent amount, including
                any interest or penalties thereon. You further agree to indemnify, hold
                harmless and defend us from any and all claims that a Service Professional
                was misclassified as an independent contractor or an employee (including,
                but not limited to, taxes, penalties, interest and attorney's fees), any
                claims that we were an employer or joint employer of a Service Professional,
                and any claims under any employment-related laws, such as those relating
                to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation,
                wage and hour laws, overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay,
                retirement benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment benefits,
                or any other employee benefits.</p>
              <p>Service Professionals are solely responsible for all aspects of the Services
                they perform, including the quality, timing, legality, or failure to provide
                Services. Loconomics does not control the actions or inactions of Users.</p>
              <p>Loconomics does not provide any materials or supplies to provide the Services.
                Service Professionals must provide their own tools and equipment.</p>
              <p>Service Professionals manage their own schedules, availability, pricing,
                and quality of Services provided.</p>
              <p>Loconomics does not require training for Service Professionals, apart
                from training that the Service Professional must obtain for providing Licensed
                Professional Services. However, optional training may be offered as a benefit
                for Loconomics Owners.</p>
              <p>Service Professionals are encouraged to advertise independently.</p>
              <p>The purpose of forming Loconomics is to provide ideal working opportunities
                and conditions to independent Service Professionals. Loconomics’ cooperative
                structure aims to provide Service Professionals with access to the benefits
                of traditional employment, while ensuring that Services Professionals remain
                independent and have choice and flexibility in their work.</p>

                or message charges or other charges from your phone carrier may apply to
                calls or text messages we send you. You may opt-out of receiving text messages
                from Loconomics by replying with the word "STOP" to a text message from
                Loconomics.</p>
              <p>Loconomics may send you confirmation and other transactional emails regarding
                the Services. Loconomics may also send you emails about services that we
                think might interest you (“Promotional Emails”). The Promotional Emails
                include an option for you to opt out of receiving such emails.</p>
              <p>	<strong>6. Rules for Service Professionals</strong>

              </p>
              <p>Service Professionals must be individuals, not agencies or people acting
                on behalf of agencies; however, worker-owned cooperatives and nonprofit
                organizations may be Service Professionals if approved as Owners according
                to the Bylaws. The profile you create must represent a single person performing
                Services. You may not have employees, agents, or substitutes provide Services
                on your behalf.</p>
              <p>Service Professionals may choose to partner with other Service Professionals
                using our group booking functionality to perform particular Services that
                require more than one person. In such cases, Service Professionals must
                still be individuals, not agencies or people acting on behalf of agencies.</p>
              <p>Service Professionals must perform Services at the scheduled time and
                as described to the Client when booking or, if you are unable to fulfill
                Services at the scheduled time, you must promptly notify the Client and
                cancel or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>Service Professionals are responsible for managing availability for online
                appointments including maintaining the accuracy and completeness of available
                times, Services available, service locations and/or service areas, and
                all other information necessary for Clients to schedule online appointments
                with you.</p>
              <p>Service Professionals offering mental and health care Services that are
                reimbursable by federal and state health care programs agree:</p>
              <p>a) not to seek reimbursement from any third party payer (including, but
                not limited to, Medicare or Medi-Cal) for any portion, in whole or in part,
                of the Services booked through the Loconomics Service, and to accept as
                payment in full the amount paid by Client for the Services at the time
                of booking (or later, if so agreed);</p>
              <p>b) not to offer Services at discounted or promotional pricing through
                the Loconomics Service, and not to advertise any such discounts or promotions
                through the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>The Services cannot, under any circumstances, include:</p>
              <p>a) sexual activity; or</p>
              <p>b) unlawful activity of any kind.</p>
              <p>	<strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally able to provide your Services.</strong>

              </p>
              <p>You represent that you have the legal ability in your jurisdiction and
                where you are marketing your Services to perform the Services listed in
                the Loconomics Service. Without limiting the foregoing, you represent that
                you have any license required to provide your Services and are willing
                to undergo a Background Check prior to providing Sensitive/Licensed Professional
                Services (see also Section 18, “Background Checks”).</p>
              <p>	<strong>7. Rules for Clients</strong>

              </p>
              <p>Clients are solely responsible for choosing suitable Service Professionals.
                Loconomics does not endorse any Service Professional. When acting as a
                Client, you agree that Loconomics is not responsible or liable for unsatisfactory
                Services performed by Service Professionals. You should make whatever investigation
                you deem necessary or appropriate before hiring or engaging a Service Professional
                (see also Section 18, “Background Checks”).</p>
              <p>Clients are responsible for attending (if so agreed at the time of booking)
                all appointments made through the Loconomics Service or, if you are unable
                to attend an appointment, to promptly notify the Service Professional and
                cancel or reschedule using the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>You may not hire Service Professionals with the purpose of reselling their
                Services.</p>
              <p>You will take the necessary safety precautions when meeting Service Professionals
                to ensure both their and your own safety.</p>
              <p>You accept responsibility to confirm that the Service Professional’s identity
                and professional license or certification (if required) match the information
                on their profile.</p>
              <p>	<strong>8. Fee Structure</strong>

              </p>
              <p>Joining Loconomics, viewing profiles, and viewing descriptions of Services
                are free. Current fees for all services are listed at <a href="http://www.loconomics.com/fees">www.loconomics.com/fees</a>.
                The following provides a general overview of fee structure, which specific
                fee amounts are subject to change.</p>
              <p>If you are a Service Professional, you may use the Loconomics Service
                free of charge for a limited time per the promotional terms (“Trial Period”).
                After the Trial Period has ended, payment of a monthly or annual fee “User
                Fee” is required to continue using the Loconomics Service. A valid credit
                card is required, and the User Fee is billed in advance on a monthly or
                annual basis “Billing Period” in accordance with our pricing schedule.
                Payment for the first Billing Period of service will become due immediately
                upon the end of the Trial Period; if you have not yet entered your credit
                card information, we will prompt you for this information. You must enter
                your credit card information before the end of the Trial Period or your
                account will become inaccessible. After your credit card information is
                entered, your credit card will be immediately charged for the first Billing
                Period of service. Thereafter, your credit card will be billed for each
                Billing Period after the Trial Period until your account is terminated
                by you or by Loconomics. You warrant that the credit card you enter is
                good and valid, and that you are authorized to use such credit card. You
                authorize Loconomics to charge such credit card for amounts due for the
                Loconomics Service. Loconomics reserves the right to suspend or cancel
                your account if a charge to your credit card is denied or disputed. All
                payments are non-refundable; Loconomics does not refund for partial months
                of service or non-use of the Loconomics Service. All fees are exclusive
                of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities with respect
                to your use of the Loconomics Service, and you shall be responsible for
                payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.<strong></strong>

              </p>
              <p>Loconomics may charge a fee to Clients upon booking of Services through
                the Loconomics Service. Any “Booking Fee” will be disclosed at the time
                the booking is made.</p>
              <p>Loconomics does not intentionally charge any Booking Fee for any mental
                or health care Services regulated under federal or state law prohibiting
                such fees. Should you feel a Booking Fee has been charged in error for
                such Services, please e-mail <a href="mailto:support@loconomics.com?subject=Booking%20Fee%20Error">support@loconomics.com</a> and
                it will be refunded and corrected.</p>
              <p>Loconomics charges a set fee for certain premium services, such as a Background
                Check. The cost of a premium service is disclosed at the time you sign
                up for the premium service.<strong></strong>

              </p>
              <p>Loconomics deducts the PSP’s payment processing fees from the total amount
                paid by a Client for Services before transferring the Payment Amount owed
                to a Service Professional.</p>
              <p>Loconomics reserves the right to change the fee structure set forth above,
                at its sole discretion. Loconomics will give Users at least fourteen (14)
                calendar days’ notice of any change to the fee structure by posting the
                change on the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>	<strong>9. Payments, Adjustments, and Cancellations</strong>

              </p>
              <p>Users of the Loconomics Service may be required to provide their credit
                card or bank account details to Loconomics and the Payment Service Provider
                “PSP” retained by Loconomics (currently, Braintree, a division of PayPal,
                Inc.).</p>
              <p>The cost of Services booked through the Loconomics Service, any agreed
                out of pocket expenses owed to the Service Professional, any tip or gratuity,
                if applicable, and any service fees owed to Loconomics for the use of the
                Loconomics Service are collectively referred to as the “Payment Amount.”</p>
              <p>When payment is required when booking Services, Loconomics will charge
                the Client’s credit card the Payment Amount after the appointment for the
                booked Services. Loconomics may also put a hold on the Client’s credit
                card for the Payment Amount at the time the appointment is booked through
                the Loconomics Service to ensure that payment can be taken at the appropriate
                time. Certain Services may require that, by a clearly stated deadline,
                a Client and/or Service Professional mark that Services are complete after
                the appointment is finished and/or finalize a Payment Amount. Should the
                User not complete the requested actions before the deadline, the User forfeits
                their right to make any adjustments.</p>
              <p>When payment is not required at the time of booking an appointment, the
                Client agrees to pay the Service Professional the Payment Amount using
                the Service Professional’s preferred payment option(s).</p>
              <p>Service Professionals may make bundles or packages available in which
                Users can purchase multiple Services or sessions in a single transaction.
                All sessions of the Services must be booked through the Loconomics Service.
                Service Professionals may set an expiration date for any bundle or package,
                and any unused package value is lost as of the expiration date.</p>
              <p>Clients may have the option of choosing that the Services to be repeated
                on a regular basis (“Recurrent Services”). For example, a Client may choose
                that Services be performed every two weeks. When a Client chooses Recurrent
                Services, Loconomics will automatically schedule those Recurrent Services
                to occur on future dates indefinitely at the frequency requested by the
                Client. The Client's credit card will be charged for the Recurrent Services
                as the appointments for Services occur and for any applicable cancellation
                fees. Loconomics cannot guarantee appointments for Recurrent Services will
                not be canceled or rescheduled by the Service Professional.</p>
              <p>Services may be canceled or rescheduled up to the "Cancellation Period"
                (the advance notice prior to the scheduled appointment time required to
                effect an appointment cancellation outlined in the Service Professional’s
                “Cancellation Policy”) of the appointment takes place. If you wish to cancel
                or reschedule Services, you must do so by using the appointment cancellation
                feature through the Loconomics Service prior to any Cancellation Period
                for such Services. You understand and agree that should you cancel or reschedule
                your Services after the Cancellation Period or if you do not show up for
                your appointment time, you may be charged part of or the full value of
                the Services in accordance with the Service Professional’s Cancellation
                Policy (“Cancellation Fee”).</p>
              <p>Service Professionals set their own Cancellation Policies, and Loconomics
                must enforce these Cancellation Policies. It is therefore very important
                to understand a Service Professional’s Cancellation Policy prior to attempting

                and agreed to the PSP Agreement. Please note that Loconomics is not a party
                to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed

                Agreement.</p>

                and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your own tax

                unable to reach a resolution, Loconomics will make the final decision regarding

                which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
                does not know or suspect to exist in their favor at the time of executing
                the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected
                their settlement with the debtor."</p>

              <p>b) The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal
                Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor
                claims of privilege recognized at law;</p>
              <p>c) There shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class
                or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or Loconomic’s
                individual claims, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims
                of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;</p>
              <p>d) In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration
                will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Loconomics
                will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the
                arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration
                from being cost-prohibitive; and</p>
              <p>e) With the exception of subpart (c) above, if any part of this arbitration
                provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise
                conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance
                of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed
                in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal
                or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart
                (c) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety
                of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor
                Loconomics shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</p>
              <p>	<strong>19. Background Checks</strong>

              </p>
              <p>Service Professionals may choose, and in some cases are required, to undergo
                Background Checks. These Background Checks are carried out in accordance
                with the “Background Check Policy” adopted by Loconomics, as well as applicable
                federal and state law. This Background Check Policy may be amended from
                time to time and a copy is available upon request to Service Professionals
                and Clients. Pursuant to this Background Check, Loconomics obtains Background
                Checks for Service Professionals seeking to provide Sensitive Services,
                Licensed Professional Services, and in some cases, others. The results
                of these Background Checks are confidential and specific information contained
                therein may not be disclosed, in whole or in part (for example, information
                about arrests or specific convictions may not be disclosed). In order to
                provide Clients an informed basis upon which to make hiring decisions,
                Loconomics will summarize the results of the Background Checks using the
                following Tier System and will post only the Service Professional’s Tier
                System ranking publicly on the Loconomics website, in accordance with the
                following:</p>
              <p>a) If the results of the Service Professional’s Background Check show
                no flagged items or only minor traffic violations, the Service Professional
                shall be ranked in the “Green Tier;”</p>
              <p>b) If the results of the Service Professional’s Background Check show
                that the Service Professional has been convicted of an offense involving
                serious violent acts, or child or elder abuse (excluding statutory rape
                offenses) then the Service Professional shall presumptively be ranked in
                the “Red Tier,” subject to Pre-Adverse Action Procedures described in the
                Policy. In the event that the Service Professional is assigned a “Red Tier”
                ranking, the Service Professional may offer to provide non-Sensitive/Licensed
                Professional Services, but Loconomics shall post the “Red Tier” notation
                assigned to the Service Professional on the Service Professional’s profile
                page (either directly or accessible by link);</p>
              <p>c) For Service Professionals who are not ranked as a presumptive Red Tier
                or automatic Green Tier, Loconomics will conduct a case-by-base review,
                considering the factors outlined in the Background Check Policy. After
                conducting this review, if Loconomics believes that the Service Professional’s
                suitability to offer Sensitive/Licensed Professional Services is below-average,
                but that the Service Professional should be permitted to offer these Sensitive/Licensed
                Professional Services, then Loconomics shall assign the Service Professional
                a “Yellow Tier” ranking in order to aid Clients in making informed decisions,
                subject to Pre-Adverse Action Procedures described in the Background Check
                Policy. If Loconomics believes that the Service Professional is not suitable
                to offer Sensitive/Licensed Professional Services, then Loconomics shall
                assign the Service Professional a “Red Tier” ranking in order to aid clients
                in making informed decisions, subject to Pre-Adverse Action Procedures
                described in the Policy. If Loconomics believes that the Service Professional’s
                Background Check showed no indication that the Service Professional is
                unsuitable to offer Sensitive/Licensed Professional Services, then Loconomics
                shall assign the Service Professional a “Green Tier” ranking.</p>
              <p>Loconomics cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy
                or reliability of Background Check information, the Tier System and the
                decisions made thereunder, or any other information provided by or about

                THE SERVICE WHEN COMMITTED BY ANY SERVICE PROFESSIONAL OR CLIENT OF THE

                FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY, DAMAGE, OR LOSS SUSTAINED BY SERVICE PROFESSIONALS
                IN CONNECTION WITH CLIENT’S USE OF THE BACKGROUND CHECKS, TIER RESULTS,
                OR OTHER SUMMARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING MISUSE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THESE
                RESULTS BY CLIENTS. NEITHER LOCONOMICS NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS
                SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY, DAMAGE, OR LOSS SUSTAINED BY CLIENT
                RESULTING FROM INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE BACKGROUND CHECKS, MISREPORTED
                TIER RESULTS, OR ANY OTHER INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE SUMMARY INFORMATION
                PROVIDED TO CLIENT. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED SOLELY AS A COURTESY TO

                ("Liabilities") that you may suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or

              <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to and hereby waive
                and release Loconomics and its subsidiaries, affiliates partners, officers,
                directors, staff members, Owners and agents from any liabilities arising
                from or related to:</p>
              <p>a) any act or omission of a Service Professional in connection with the
                Services, including a Service Professional’s failure to comply with applicable
                law and/or failure to abide by the terms of Services; and/or</p>
              <p>b) any Services, any action or inaction by a Service Professional; and/or</p>
              <p>c) any indirect, special, punitive, consequential, (including, lost profits
                or lost data collected through the Services), or incidental damages, whether

                or other tort, breach of any statutory duty, indemnity or contribution,
                or otherwise, even if Loconomics has been advised of the possibility of
                such damages. In no event will Loconomics’ liability arising out of or
                related to this agreement exceed the amounts paid by you for the Services
                or five hundred dollars, whichever is less.</p>

              <p>	<strong>Definitions</strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>Except as otherwise defined herein, any and all capitalized terms in this
                Agreement shall have the definitions set forth in the HIPAA Security and
                Privacy Rule. In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of
                this Agreement and mandatory provisions of the HIPAA Security and Privacy
                Rule, as amended, the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule shall control. Where
                provisions of this Agreement are different than those mandated in the HIPAA
                Security and Privacy Rule, but are nonetheless permitted by the HIPAA Security
                and Privacy Rule, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.</p>
              <p>The term “Protected Health Information” or “PHI” shall have the definition
                set forth in the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, limited to PHI that is
                created, received, maintained, or transmitted on behalf of Covered Entity
                by Business Associate pursuant to the Agreement. “Protected Health Information”
                includes without limitation “Electronic Protected Health Information” or
                “EPHI,” as defined in the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, limited to EPHI
                that is created, received, maintained, or transmitted on behalf of Covered
                Entity by Business Associate pursuant to the Agreement.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Confidentiality and Security Requirements</strong>

              </p>
              <p>Business Associate agrees to the following obligations:</p>
              <p>	<strong>Use or Disclosure of PHI.</strong>
Business Associate agrees to
                use or disclose any Protected Health Information solely: (i) for meeting
                its obligations as set forth in any agreements between the Parties evidencing
                their business relationship, for services as described in such agreement(s),
                or (ii) as required by applicable law, rule or regulation, or by any accrediting
                or credentialing organization to whom Covered Entity is required to disclose
                such information or as otherwise permitted or required under this Agreement,
                the Arrangement Agreement (if consistent with this Agreement and the HIPAA
                Security and Privacy Rule), or the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, and
                (iii) as would be permitted by the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule if such
                use or disclosure were made by Covered Entity. All such uses and disclosures
                shall be subject to the limits set forth in 45 CFR § 164.514 regarding
                limited data sets and 45 CFR § 164.502(b) regarding the minimum necessary
                requirements. Business Associate agrees, to the extent that Business Associate
                is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity’s obligation(s) under Subpart
                E of 45 C.F.R. Part 164, to comply with the requirements of Subpart E of
                45 C.F.R. Part 164 that apply to Covered Entity in the performance of such
                obligation(s).</p>
              <p>	<strong>Disposition of PHI.</strong>
Upon termination of this Agreement,
                if feasible, Business Associate will return or destroy all Protected Health
                Information received from or created or received by Business Associate
                on behalf of Covered Entity that Business Associate still maintains in
                any form and retain no copies of such information. It may not be feasible
                for Business Associate to return or destroy all copies of Protected Health
                Information. In such cases, where Business Associate determines, in its
                sole discretion, that such return or destruction is not feasible, the Parties
                will extend the protections of this Agreement to the information and Business
                Associate will limit further uses and disclosures solely to those purposes
                as originally intended under this Agreement.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Security of PHI.</strong>
Business Associate agrees to ensure that
                its agents, including a subcontractor, that create, receive, maintain,
                or transmit Protected Health Information on behalf of Business Associate
                agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to Business Associate
                with respect to such information and agree to implement reasonable and
                appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
                of any of such information which is Electronic Protected Health Information.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Notification of Breach of PHI.</strong>
Business Associate shall,
                following the discovery of a breach of unsecured PHI, as defined in the
                HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, notify the Covered Entity of such breach
                pursuant to the terms of 45 CFR § 164.410 and reasonably cooperate in the
                Covered Entity’s breach analysis procedures, including risk assessment,
                if requested. A breach shall be treated as discovered by Business Associate
                as of the first day on which such breach is known to Business Associate
                or, by exercising reasonable diligence, would have been known to Business
                Associate. Business Associate will provide such notification to Covered
                Entity without unreasonable delay and in no event later than twenty (20)
                calendar days after discovery of the breach. Such notification will contain
                the elements required in 45 CFR § 164.410.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Permitted Use of PHI.</strong>
Notwithstanding the prohibitions
                set forth in this Agreement, Business Associate may use and disclose Protected
                Health Information:</p>
              <p>if necessary, for the proper management and administration of Business
                Associate services or to carry out the legal responsibilities of Business
                Associate, provided that as to any such disclosure, (i) the disclosure
                is required by law; or (ii) Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances
                from the person to whom the information is disclosed that it will be held
                confidentially and used or further disclosed only as required by law or
                for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person
                notifies Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which
                the confidentiality of the information has been breached; or for data aggregation
                services, if to be provided by Business Associate for the health care operations
                of Covered Entity pursuant to any agreements between the Parties evidencing
                their business relationship, or as mutually agreed in writing by both Parties.
                For purposes of this Agreement, data aggregation services means the combining
                of Protected Health Information by Business Associate with the protected
                health information received by Business Associate in its capacity as a
                business associate of another covered entity, to permit data analyses that
                relate to the health care operations of the respective covered entities.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Safeguarding PHI.</strong>
Business Associate will implement appropriate
                safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of Protected Health Information
                other than as permitted in this Agreement or required or permitted by applicable
                law. Business Associate will implement administrative, physical, and technical
                safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality,
                integrity, and availability of any Electronic Protected Health Information
                that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits on behalf of Covered
                Entity as required by the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule and will comply,
                where applicable, with Subpart C of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 with respect to
                such Electronic Protected Health Information to prevent use or disclosure
                of such electronic PHI other than as provided for by this Agreement.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Audit of Business Associate’s Records.</strong>
The Secretary of
                Health and Human Services shall have the right to audit Business Associate’s
                records and practices related to use and disclosure of Protected Health
                Information to ensure Covered Entity’s compliance with the terms of the
                HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Unauthorized Use of PHI.</strong>
Business Associate shall report
                to Covered Entity any use or disclosure of Protected Health Information
                which is not in compliance with the terms of this Agreement of which it
                becomes aware. Busines Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Security
                Incident of which it becomes aware.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Availability of PHI</strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong>Restrictions on Disclosures of PHI.</strong>
Business Associate
                agrees to comply with any requests for restrictions on certain disclosures
                of Protected Health Information maintained in a Designated Record Set pursuant
                to Section 164.522 of the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule to which Covered
                Entity has agreed and of which Business Associate is notified by Covered
                Entity, if any.</p>
              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong>Access.</strong>
Business Associate agrees to comply with any requests
                for preferences of access of Protected Health Information maintained in
                a Designated Record Set pursuant to Section 164.522 of the HIPAA Security
                and Privacy Rule to which Covered Entity has agreed and of which Business
                Associate is notified by Covered Entity, if any. Business Associate agrees
                to make available Protected Health Information to the extent and in the
                manner required by Section 164.524 of the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule.
                Business Associate agrees to make Protected Health Information maintained
                in a Designated Record Set available for amendment and incorporate any
                amendments to Protected Health Information maintained in a Designated Record
                Set in accordance with the requirements of Section 164.526 of the HIPAA
                Security and Privacy Rule.</p>

              <p>	<strong>Accounting.</strong>

                make Protected Health Information available for purposes of accounting
                of disclosures, as required by Section 164.528 of the HIPAA Security and
                Privacy Rule and Section 13405(c)(3) of the HITECH Act. Business Associate
                and Covered Entity shall cooperate in providing any accounting required
                on a timely basis.</p>

              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong>Changes in Authorization.</strong>
Covered Entity shall inform
                Business Associate, in writing and in a timely manner, of any changes in,
                or withdrawal of, any authorization provided to Covered Entity by any Individual
                pursuant to 45 CFR § 164.508, to the extent that such changes or withdrawal
                may affect Business Associate’s use or disclosure of PHI. In addition,
                Covered Entity shall notify Business Associate, in writing and in a timely
                manner, of any restriction to the use or disclosure of PHI that Covered
                Entity has agreed to in accordance with 45 CFR § 164.522, to the extent

                breach by Covered Entity of any obligation under the HIPAA Security and
                Privacy Rule as such breach relates to PHI as defined herein. Covered Entity
                shall not request Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner
                that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule
                if done by Covered Entity, and Business Associate is not required to use
                or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA

              </p>
              <p>	<strong>Term.</strong>
This Agreement shall commence when the Covered Entity
                begins using the Loconomics Service and shall continue until (i) either

                cure to the other Party if the Party reasonably determines that the other
                Party has violated any material term of this Agreement. If the other party

              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong>No Third Parties.</strong>
Except as expressly stated herein or
                within the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, the Parties to this Agreement
                do not intend to create any rights in any third parties.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Entire Agreement, Amendments, Assignment, Relationship, Waiver, Governing Law.</strong>
This
                Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties in connection with
                the subject matter herein and this Agreement may be amended or modified
                only in a writing signed by the Parties. Either party may assign, sublicense,
                delegate or transfer all or any portion of its rights or responsibilities
                under this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise to any subsidiaries
                or affiliates thereof, or to any other party, in connection with a sale
                of the business related to this Agreement or to the Arrangement Agreement.
                Any assignment of this Agreement by Business Associate in connection with
                a sale of this business shall relieve Business Associate from any further
                liability hereunder. None of the provisions of this Agreement are intended
                to create, nor will they be deemed to create any relationship between the
                Parties other than that of independent parties contracting with each other
                solely for the purposes of effecting the provisions of this Agreement and
                any other agreements between the Parties evidencing their business relationship.
                This Agreement will be governed by California law, without regard to its
                choice of law provisions. No change, waiver or discharge of any liability
                or obligation hereunder on any one or more occasions shall be deemed a
                waiver of performance of any continuing or other obligation, or shall prohibit
                enforcement of any obligation, on any other occasion. In the event that
                any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
                to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions of this
                Agreement will remain in full force and effect. In addition, in the event
                a Party believes in good faith that any provision of this Agreement fails
                to comply with the then-current requirements of the HIPAA Security and
                Privacy Rule, including any then-current requirements of the HITECH Act
                or its regulations, such Party shall notify the other Party in writing.
                For a period of up to thirty (30) days, the Parties shall address in good
                faith such concern and amend the terms of this Agreement, if necessary
                to bring it into compliance. If, after such thirty (30)-day period, the
                Agreement fails to comply with the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rule, including
                the HITECH Act, then either Party has the right to terminate upon written
                notice to the other Party.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Minimum Requirements.</strong>

                by or controlled by Loconomics) who may only use the Personal Information
                for the purposes described herein.</p>

                than credit card information) with Service Professionals whose Loconomics
                Services you have purchased to provide their Services to you. We provide

                or participated in an offer, contest or other activity sponsored or offered
                through Loconomics on behalf of the Service Professional. We may also provide

                contest, distribution partnership, or other activity that is provided by
                or in conjunction with Loconomics and its business partners and in which
                you have elected to participate. For example, if you are referred to Loconomics
                from a business partner's website or through an invitation facilitated
                by or in conjunction with a Loconomics business partner, Loconomics may
                provide that business partner with Contact Information and Transactional

                in litigation or a regulatory action, and when required or advised to do
                so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar legal process,
                including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts where we
                operate. If Loconomics is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of
                all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent
                notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal
                Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal
                Information.</p>

                business partners, or other third parties with reports that contain aggregated
                and statistical data about Users.</p>
              <p>h) Service Professional may appear in a User’s Favorites page, and Loconomics
                may contact this User through email, text, or push notification to promote
                booking that Service Professional’s Services or others using the Loconomics
                Service. Users have the option of managing their communications preferences
                or opting out.</p>
              <p>i) When a particular Service Professional is added to your Favorites Page,
                that information will only be made public to those with whom you choose
                to share your profile URL. Doing so will enable other Users to search,
                visit, or book appointments from your Favorites Page. Additionally, your
                page will display your real name, partial name, or pseudo name, as well
                as any other information you provided, including photographs, bios, and
                city and state. You may, however, hide this information from the public
                by marking your Favorite Page as Private.</p>
              <p>j) If you are a Service Professional:</p>

                Business Partners and affiliates with which Loconomics is working;</p>
              <p>b. We may feed Service Professional Information to third party websites
                (excluding Client lists), which may result in Service Professional Information
                appearing on a third-party website, mobile application or in search engine
                results; and such results may include a corresponding link to schedule
                an appointment through Loconomics.</p>
              <p>c. We may use certain Contact Information to promote your Services through
                a variety of online and offline advertising and promotion mediums, including,
                but not limited to Google, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, Twitter, email
                distribution lists, and third-party Business Partners and Affiliates.</p>
              <p>d. If you have participated in any joint Loconomics service offerings
                or promotions with other Partners, Loconomics may disclose your Personal
                Information to its Partners and/or advertisers, as part of such offer,
                contest, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Loconomics
                and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate.</p>

              <p>	<strong>6. Cookies and Related Technologies</strong>

              </p>
              <p>When you use the Loconomics Service, we collect certain information by
                automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel
                tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you
                use the Loconomics Service, your browser and devices communicate with servers
                operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate
                and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.</p>
              <p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server
                logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices,
                which are then transmitted back to the Loconomics Service by your computers
                or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by
                us, our business partners or our service providers.</p>
              <p>For example, when you visit the Loconomics Service, Loconomics and our
                service providers may place cookies, including persistent cookies, on your
                computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you
                return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized
                experience. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as
                retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your
                User ID if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences (e.g.,
                the cities for which you want to be shown Services).</p>
              <p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages
                or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed
                specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the
                pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our
                service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications
                and improve our web pages and promotions.</p>
              <p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other
                technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices
                you use to access the Loconomics Service, your operating system type or
                mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as
                well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of
                your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web
                servers. Our server logs also record the IP addresses of the devices you
                use to interact with the Sites. We may also collect information about the
                website you were visiting before you came to the Loconomics Service and
                the website you visit after you leave our Site, if this information is
                supplied to us by your browser.</p>

                is used in nonidentifiable ways, the Loconomics Service but we may also
                associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies
                with Personal Information. Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware
                device allow us to receive Mobile Location Information, we will collect
                that automatically. This Privacy Policy governs how we would use these
                types of information.</p>

              <p>	<strong>8. Your Choices</strong>

              </p>
              <p>We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we

                to some types of messages, and may choose to unsubscribe from others. You
                may update your subscription preferences from time to time. Please note
                that even if you unsubscribe from promotional email or text messages, we
                may still need to contact you with important transactional information
                related to your account and your purchases. For example, even if you have
                unsubscribed from our promotional email or text messages, we will still
                send you confirmations when you book a service through the Loconomics Service.</p>

              </p>
              <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. Loconomics
                has implemented an information security program that contains administrative,
                technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard
                Personal Information. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit
                card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information
                using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
              <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information
                submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method
                of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is
                100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact
                us at <a href="mailto:support@loconomics.com?subject=Questions%20about%20Security">support@loconomics.com</a> .</p>

              <p>Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of
                California can obtain certain information about the types of Personal Information

              <p>	<strong>BACKGROUND CHECK POLICY</strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong>1. Guiding Principle</strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>Loconomics intends to facilitate the provision of Services in a manner
                that is both informed and fair. For certain Services offered via the Loconomics
                Service, Loconomics’ Board and Owners have come to the consensus that the
                Loconomics community will benefit if Service Professionals undergo Background
                Checks prior to the provision of these Services. For other Services, Background
                Checks will be done at the option of the Service Professional. In either
                case, Loconomics will not perform a Background Check without the consent
                of the Service Professional. The policy for and use of Background Check
                information is detailed in this Policy below.</p>
              <p>	<strong>2. Definitions</strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>The <strong>Authorized Initiator</strong> is the person(s) formally designated
                by Loconomics as authorized to initiate Background Checks with Loconomics’
                third-party vendor, HireRight, or another third-party vendor chosen by
                Loconomics. The Authorized Initiator <u>does not</u> perform Background Checks.
                Rather, the Authorized Initiator oversees the Background Check process,
                by managing Loconomics’ third-party vendor(s), informing HireRight of the
                identities of people for whom it wishes to run Background Checks, making
                decisions regarding what type of Background Check is appropriate, interpreting
                Background Check records once provided by HireRight and displaying information
                using the Red/Yellow/Green Tiering system described in this Policy, including
                determining whether a Service Professional is eligible to provide Sensitive
                Services or Licensed Professional Services.</p>
              <p>A <strong>Background Check</strong> is defined as carrying out any one or
                more of the following on a Service Professional: (1) criminal background
                check; (2) license/certification history check; (3) verbally confirming
                references or employment; (4) educational history check; (5) sex and/or
                violent offender check; (6) credit history check; or (7) others. The nature
                and scope of the Background Check will vary on a position-by-position basis
                and will be determined at Loconomics’ sole discretion. The Background Check
                may be carried out prior to a person becoming a Service Professional on
                Loconomics or after the time that the person has become a Service Professional
                on Loconomics.</p>
              <p>A <strong>Service Professional</strong> is defined as a person who has registered
                to provide Services through the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Licensed Professional Services</strong>
are defined as services
                for which the state of California imposes licensure, certification, registration,
                or similar requirements upon the persons who perform these services.</p>
              <p>	<strong>Sensitive Services</strong>
are defined as services offered to
                and specifically targeting vulnerable persons, such as those involving
                care for children, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. The mere
                offering of Services to the general public, including the elderly, children,
                and persons with disabilities, does not make the Services Sensitive Services.
                Rather, Services specifically targeted at these vulnerable populations
                are Sensitive Services. Loconomics shall have sole discretion to determine
                which Services offered via its Service constitute Sensitive Services.</p>
              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong>3. Introduction</strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong><u> </u></strong>

              </p>
              <p>This Policy describes when Service Professionals will be required to undergo
                Background Checks. Service Professionals may register to provide Services
                through the Loconomics Service without undergoing a Background Check. However,
                if a Service Professional wishes to offer to provide Sensitive Services
                via the Loconomics Service, the Service Professional may not offer to provide
                these Sensitive Services until the requirements described in this Policy
                have been fulfilled, including the completion of a Background Check. Similarly,
                any person holding a professional license or certification may become a
                Service Professional of Loconomics, but that Service Professional may not
                offer to provide these Professional Services via the Loconomics Service
                until the Background Check requirements imposed by this policy for professionals
                have been fulfilled. Finally, any Service Professional may voluntarily
                choose to undergo a Background Check, in which case the Background Check
                must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this Policy.</p>
              <p>Information discovered through the Background Check process will be used
                solely for the purpose of evaluating a Service Professional’s suitability
                to provide Sensitive Services, Professional Services, or other Services.
                It will not be used to discriminate against a Service Professional on the
                basis of race, color, religion/creed, sex/gender, age, sexual orientation,
                gender identity/expression, national origin, genetic information, marital/familial
                status, disability, military, veteran status, or any other classification
                protected by law.</p>
              <p>	<strong>4. Policy</strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<strong> </strong>

              </p>
              <p>	<u>Required Background Checks</u>

              </p>
              <p>1. <em>Sensitive Services</em>

              </p>
              <p>a. Background Checks are required for any Service Professional offering
                to provide Sensitive Services via the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>i. The Background Check shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures
                outlined in this Policy.</p>
              <p>ii. Loconomics shall publicly post the results of the Background Check
                only in summary form, utilizing the Red/Yellow/Green tiering system described
                below in order to provide Clients information upon which to make informed
                decisions. In no event shall Loconomics post specific information regarding
                the results of the Background Check (e.g., Loconomics shall not post any
                information about specific offenses committed or the particular type of
                conviction involved). Loconomics shall consider the Service Professional’s
                privacy at all times when posting the results of the Background Check.</p>
              <p>iii. Any Service Professional who does not wish to undergo a Background
                Check may inform Loconomics that the Service Professional no longer wishes
                to provide Sensitive Services via the Loconomics Service by e-mailing

              <p>2. <em>Licensed Professional Services</em>

              </p>
              <p>a. Background Checks are required for any Service Professional seeking
                to provide Licensed Professional Services.</p>
              <p>i. The Background Check shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures
                outlined in this Policy.</p>
              <p>ii. The Background Check may involve the verification of a professional
                license, certification, or registration and may in some cases also be carried
                out simultaneously with a Background Check connected with the provision
                of Sensitive Services (e.g., if the Service Professional wishes to offer
                to provide Sensitive Services).</p>
              <p>iii. Loconomics shall either (a) publicly post or link to the results
                of the license/certification history check in summary form; or (b) publicly
                post the results of the Background Check in summary form, utilizing the
                Red/Yellow/Green tiering system described below in order to provide Clients
                information upon which to make informed decisions. In no event shall Loconomics
                post specific information regarding the results of the Background Check
                (e.g., Loconomics shall not post any information about specific offenses
                committed or the particular type of conviction involved). Loconomics shall
                consider the Service Professional’s privacy at all times when posting the
                results of the Background Check.</p>
              <p>iv. Any Service Professional who does not wish to undergo a Background
                Check may inform Loconomics that the Service Professional no longer wishes
                to provide Professional Services via the Loconomics Service by e-mailing
                <a

              <p>	<u>Discretionary Background Checks</u>

              </p>
              <p>1. <em>Discretionary Background Checks for Service Professionals not Providing Sensitive Services or Licensed Professional Services</em>

              </p>
              <p>a. If a Service Professional is not required to undergo a Background Check
                as described above, the Service Professional may voluntarily choose to
                complete a Background Check. If the Service Professional opts to the complete
                the Background Check, Loconomics shall publicly post the results of the
                Background Check in summary form, utilizing the “Red/Yellow/Green” tiering
                system described below in order to provide Clients information upon which
                to make informed decisions. In no event shall Loconomics post specific
                information regarding the results of the Background Check (e.g., Loconomics
                shall not post any information about specific offenses committed or the
                particular type of conviction involved). Loconomics shall consider the
                Service Professional’s privacy at all times when posting the results of
                the Background Check.</p>
              <p>2. <em>Discretionary Background Checks at Loconomics’ Request</em>

              </p>
              <p>a. Background Checks may be required for Service Professionals at the
                discretion of Loconomics for any Service Professional or position not otherwise
                defined herein for any reason and at any time. In the event that a discretionary
                Background Check is carried out, the Service Professional may choose to
                withdraw as a Service Professional from Loconomics if the Service Professional
                does not wish to undergo a Background Check. If the Service Professional
                opts to complete the Background Check, Loconomics shall publicly post the
                results of the Background Check in summary form, utilizing the “Red/Yellow/Green”
                tiering system described below in order to provide Clients information
                upon which to make informed decisions. In no event shall Loconomics post
                specific information regarding the results of the Background Check (e.g.,
                Loconomics shall not post any information about specific offenses committed
                or the particular type of conviction involved). Loconomics shall consider
                the Service Professional’s privacy at all times when posting the results
                of the Background Check.</p>
              <p>	<u> </u>

              </p>
              <p>	<u>Timing</u>

              </p>
              <p>	<u> </u>

              </p>
              <p>1. A Background Check is not required as a prerequisite of registering
                to offer Services through the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>2. A required Background Check shall be carried out prior to the time
                at which a Service Professional offers to provide any Sensitive Services
                or Professional Services via the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>3. A discretionary Background Check may be required by Loconomics at any
                time, but a Service Professional has the right to dissociate from using
                the Loconomics Service if the Service Professional does not wish to undergo
                the discretionary Background Check.</p>
              <p>4. Service Professionals who have a completed an initial Background Check
                are not required to have an additional Background Check performed unless
                they do not provide any Services via the Loconomics Service for more than
                2 years, or unless otherwise required by Loconomics, at their sole discretion.</p>
              <p>	<u>Procedures for Carrying out a Background Check in Connection with the Provision of Sensitive Services</u>

              </p>
              <p>1. Service Professionals will be notified at the time they indicate their
                intent to provide Sensitive Services that they must successfully pass a
                Background Check prior to offering to provide Sensitive Services via the
                Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>2. Background Checks will be conducted in accordance with applicable law.
                Once a Service Professional indicates their intent to provide Sensitive
                Services, Loconomics or appointed third-party vendor will provide the Service
                Professional an authorization form in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting
                Act (FCRA) and/or California Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies
                Act (ICRAA). If requested, the Service Professional will be provided a
                copy of this Background Check policy. Any Service Professional who refuses
                to sign and return this authorization form consenting to a Background Check,
                refuses to provide information necessary to conduct the Background Check,
                or provides false or misleading information will not be permitted to offer
                to provide Sensitive Services.</p>
              <p>3. Upon receiving the Service Professional’s signed authorization form,
                the Background Check will be initiated by the Authorized Initiator. All
                Background Checks will be conducted by a third party service provider (the
                “Vendor”) at the direction of the Authorized Initiator.</p>
              <p>4. Upon completion of the Background Check, the Vendor will forward the
                results to the Authorized Initiator. The Vendor shall also inform the Service
                Professional of the results, provide the Service Professional an opportunity
                to review the report, and inform the Service Professional of their rights
                under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the California Investigative Consumer
                Reporting Act.</p>
              <p>5. The Authorized Initiator will review the results in accordance with
                the Red/Yellow/Green Tier guidelines described below, provide Pre-Adverse
                Action Notices and/or Adverse Actions Notices as may be required below,
                and will make the final determination as to the Red/Yellow/Green Tier assigned
                to the Service Professional on the Service Professional’s profile page.
                If a Service Professional receives a Red Tier rating, the Service Professional
                may not offer to provide Sensitive Services via the Loconomics Service.
                The Service Professional may, however, offer to provide non-Sensitive Services
                via the Loconomics Service.</p>
              <p>6. The Loconomics online Service shall not permit a Service Professional
                to create a listing offering to provide Sensitive Services unless that
                Service Professional has passed a Background Check with satisfactory results.
                If the Service Professional attempts to create a listing offering to provide
                Sensitive Services without having undergone a Background Check, the Loconomics
                online Service will not permit the Service Professional to create this
                listing and will instruct the Service Professional as to the Background
                Check requirement. If the Service Professional attempts to add a category
                of Sensitive Services to that Service Professional’s profile page, the
                Loconomics online Service will block the Service Professional from offering
                these Sensitive Services via the Loconomics online Service.</p>
              <p>	<u>Procedures for Carrying out a Background Check in Connection with the Provision of Professional Services</u>

              </p>
              <p>1. Service Professionals will be notified at the time they indicate their
                intent to provide Licensed Professional Services that Loconomics will carry
                out a Background Check in the form of a professional licensure check. Service
                Professionals are required to disclose all professional licenses, certifications,
                or registrations to Loconomics, and failure to do so may serve as the basis
                for Loconomics to terminate the Service Professionals’ account or to take
                other action Loconomics deems appropriate to protect Loconomics and its
                Clients.</p>
              <p>2. Loconomics shall verify that any license or certificate required by
                law and issued to a Service Professional is valid and unexpired and that
                the Service Professional is in good standing with the Licensed Professional
                Services’ regulatory board(s).</p>
              <p>3. Loconomics’ reliance on publicly available, online information posted
                by the relevant professional’s regulatory board shall be considered reasonable
                and sufficient to meet the requirements for the Background Check for Service
                Professionals offering Professional Services.</p>
              <p>	<u>Red/Yellow/Green Tiering System</u>

              </p>
              <p>	<u> </u>

              </p>
              <p>1. Results from a Background Check will be considered in the following
                manner:</p>
              <p>a. <em>Automatic Green Tier</em>

              </p>
              <p>i. If the results of the Service Professional’s Background Check show
                no flagged items or only minor traffic violations, the Service Professional
                shall be ranked in the “Green Tier.”</p>
              <p>b. <em>Presumptive Red Tier</em>

              </p>
              <p>i. If the results of the Service Professional’s Background Check show
                that the Service Professional has been convicted of an offense involving
                serious violent acts, or child or persons with disabilities or elder abuse
                (excluding statutory rape offenses) then the Service Professional shall
                presumptively be ranked in the “Red Tier,” subject to the Pre-Adverse Action
                Procedures described below. The Service Professional shall not be permitted
                to offer to provide Sensitive/Professional Services unless the Service
                Professional demonstrates a compelling reason why such a “Red Tier” ranking
                is inappropriate. In the event that the Service Professional is assigned
                a “Red Tier” ranking, the Service Professional may offer to provide non-Sensitive/Professional
                Services, but Loconomics shall post the “Red Tier” notation assigned to
                the Service Professional on the Service Professional’s profile page (either
                directly or accessible by link).</p>
              <p>c. <em>Yellow Tier</em>

              </p>
              <p>i. For Service Professionals who are not ranked as a presumptive Red Tier
                or Automatic Green Tier, Loconomics will conduct a case-by-base review
                pursuant to the procedures outlined in section (d) below. After conducting
                this review, if Loconomics believes that the Service Professional’s suitability
                to offer Sensitive/Professional Services is below-average, but that the
                Service Professional should be permitted to offer these Sensitive/Professional
                Services, then Loconomics shall assign the Service Professional a “Yellow
                Tier” ranking in order to aid Clients in making informed decisions, subject
                to the Pre-Adverse Action Procedures described below.</p>
              <p>d. <em>Case-By-Case Consideration</em>

              </p>
              <p>i. For Service Professionals who are not ranked as a presumptive Red Tier
                or Automatic Green Tier, determination of the Service Professional’s suitability
                to offer Sensitive/Professional Services will be made on a case-to-case
                basis and in accordance with applicable law. Loconomics’ consideration
                shall include, but not be limited to, the following factors:</p>
              <p>1. Number of offenses or misconduct and the circumstances of each;</p>
              <p>2. Length of time between the offense or misconduct and the time at which
                the Background Check is carried out;</p>
              <p>3. Age of Service Professional at the time of the offense;</p>
              <p>4. Other employment history;</p>
              <p>5. Evidence of rehabilitation efforts (or lack thereof);</p>
              <p>6. Severity and specific circumstances of the offense or misconduct;</p>
              <p>7. The relevance of the offense or misconduct to responsibilities of the
                position;</p>
              <p>8. Nature of work to be performed;</p>
              <p>9. Whether the Service Professional has pending charges; and</p>
              <p>10. Any other relevant information, including information submitted by
                the Service Professional or requested by the Authorized Initiator.</p>
              <p>ii. Once Loconomics has considered the offenses in light of the factors
                above, Loconomics will determine whether the Service Professional should
                be assigned the ranking of Red Tier (meaning that the Service Professional
                is prohibited from offering Sensitive/Professional Services), Yellow Tier
                (meaning that the Service Professional may offer Sensitive/Professional
                Services, but that the Service Professional’s suitability for offering
                such services is below average), or Green Tier (meaning that the Service
                Professional’s Background Check showed no indication that the Service Professional
                is unsuitable to offer Sensitive/Professional Services).</p>
              <p>e. <em>Arrest Information</em>

              </p>
              <p>i. Loconomics will not consider arrest information unless the arrest resulted
                in pending criminal charges. In such circumstances, Loconomics will contact
                the Service Professional, and may contact other parties to obtain further
                information in order to assess reliability of the charge information. Loconomics
                will consider any information revealed regarding convictions, although
                a Conviction (defined as a guilty verdict, a guilty plea, or a pleas of
                Nolo Contendere of felony or misdemeanor, other than minor traffic offenses)
                shall not automatically preclude the individual from offering Sensitive
                Services or obtaining a “Green Tier” raking.</p>
              <p>f. <em>Assignment of Tier Ranking, Pre-Adverse Action Notices, and Adverse Action Notices</em>

              </p>
              <p>i. After the Authorized Initiator has evaluated the results in accordance
                with the guidelines above, the Authorized Initiator shall assign the Service
                Professional a Red, Yellow, or Green Tier ranking. If a “Yellow Tier” or
                “Red Tier” ranking is assigned, Loconomics shall follow the procedures
                described below with respect to Pre-Adverse Action Notice and Adverse Action
                Notice. The tier ranking shall be posted or linked to on the Service Professional’s
                profile page along with an explanation as to the meaning of the ranking.
                This explanation may entail a general overview as to the types of offenses
                which might justify the ranking, but the explanation shall not include
                detail as to the particular offenses committed by the Service Professional
                or otherwise inappropriately disclose the Service Professional’s private
                information.</p>
              <p>a. <em>Pre-Adverse Action Notice</em>

              </p>
              <p>i. To the extent required by applicable law, Loconomics will notify the
                Service Professional in writing that adverse information was revealed during
                the Background Check process that may impact the Service Professional’s
                ability to offer to provide services. Loconomics will provide a copy of
                the supporting Background Check report to the Service Professional along
                with a copy of “A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting
                Act.” The Service Professional will be given no less than five days to
                challenge the information provided in the report and take steps to correct
                inaccuracies or provide explanation.</p>
              <p>ii. A final adverse decision will not be made until the Service Professional’s
                new information has been considered or such time that the Service Professional
                fails to respond as required.</p>
              <p>b. <em>Adverse Action Notice</em>

              </p>
              <p>i. If, after considering the Service Professional’s response, Loconomics
                determines that the negative information revealed results in an adverse
                decision (e.g., that the Service Professional cannot offer to provide Sensitive
                Services, or that the Service Professional will be assigned a “Yellow Tier”
                or “Red Tier” ranking), a second written notification will be sent to the
                Service Professional. This notice shall include the following:</p>
              <p>1. The name, address, and phone number of the vendor Consumer Report Agency
                (CRA) that supplied the report;</p>
              <p>2. A statement that the CRA supplying the report did not make the decision
                to take the adverse action and cannot give specific reasons for it; and</p>
              <p>3. A notice of the Service Professional’s right to dispute the accuracy
                or completeness of any information the CRA furnished, and his or her right
                to an additional free consumer report from the agency upon request within
                60 days and to dispute with the CRA the accuracy or completeness of any
                information in a consumer report furnished by the agency.</p>
              <p>	<u>Responsibility for Costs</u>

              </p>
              <p>1. Service Professionals may be responsible for the costs associated with
                one (1) Background Check each for offering to provide Sensitive Services
                or Licensed Professional Services. Should the Service Professional wish
                to carry out any further Background Checks, the Service Professional shall
                be solely responsible for the costs associated with such additional Background
                Checks. Loconomics shall clearly post on its website whether Service Professionals
                are responsible for any fees associated with Background Checks and, if
                so, the amounts of such fees.</p>
              <p>	<u>Ongoing Self-Disclosure Requirements</u>

              </p>
              <p>1. All Service Professionals are required to self-disclose to Loconomics
                all post-Background Check criminal Convictions or felony charges filed
                against them that occur on or after the date they become a Service Professional
                within three business days of the Conviction or felony charge. All Service
                Professionals are required to fully and accurately disclose to Loconomics
                their past and present professional licenses, certifications, and registrations.</p>
              <p>Loconomics reserves the right to modify this Background Check Policy in
                whole or in part at any time. This Policy is intended as a guideline to
                assist in the consistent application of Loconomics’ policies and programs
                for Service Professionals. This policy does not create a contract, express
                or otherwise, with any Service Professional. Disqualification of a candidate
                based on information discovered in the Background Check is not subject
                to grievance or appeal by the Service Professional.</p>
